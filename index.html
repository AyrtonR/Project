            <p id="P1">Back in 2020, a group of three friends struggled with finding high quality kebab meals in Oulu, Finland.</p> 
            <p>They made a decision that would change their lives, and the North Ostrobothnian kebab scene forever.</p>
            <p>With their dream of a restaurant serving delicious kebab meals in a nice environment, they worked hard for couple of months.</p> 
            <p>In February 2021, the newcomer of the Kebab business, SRS Kebab, opened its doors at the beautiful Myllykatu. </p>
            <p>Ever since the restaurant and its passionate staff have given a lots of tasty and nice kebab moments for their customers. </p>
